# CA: The C Abstraction Header Only Library

All of the C functions that I would rather not write again.

##### Todos

- Vectors
- String handling
  - spliting a String
  - finding a character in a string
  - etc...
- File handling
  - default open close...
- Iterators and predicates
- class like structs using function pointers?
